## 📌 Introduction

<!-- tag::intro[] -->
Welcome to **DEV Cheat Sheets**, a personal collection of notes and quick references gathered from courses, books, and other various learning resources. This repository serves as a convenient reference guide for myself and others.

These notes reflect my own learning journey and are intended to be a helpful resource for anyone looking to refresh their memory or gain insights into key programming concepts.
