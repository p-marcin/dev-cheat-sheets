== Pgpool restarts due to "Sorry, too many clients already"

In order to guarantee that the application connection requests are never rejected, and that the connection requests wait until a database connection is available, the following condition should be met:

----
max_pool * num_init_children <= (max_connections - superuser_reserved_connections)
----

You can check `max_connections` and `superuser_reserved_connections` in PostgreSQL with these queries:

[,postgresql]
----
SHOW max_connections;
SHOW superuser_reserved_connections;
----

TIP: Check https://www.pgpool.net/mediawiki/index.php/Relationship_between_max_pool,_num_init_children,_and_max_connections[Relationship between max pool, num init children, and max connections^]

== Keep Pgpool connections at stable level

Without below numbers, idle connections were slowly increasing and had been reaching the limit of `max_connections=400` (memory usage was also quickly increasing):

* `connection_life_time=60`
* `child_life_time=60`
