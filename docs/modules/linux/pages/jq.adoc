== Overview

`jq` filters run on a stream of JSON data. The input to `jq` is parsed as a sequence of whitespace-separated JSON values which are passed through the provided filter one at a time. The output(s) of the filter are written to standard output, as a sequence of newline-separated JSON data.

.Parsing JSON response
[,bash]
----
response=$(cat << EOF
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "items": [
    "Sword",
    "Shield"
  ]
}
EOF
)

echo "${response}" | jq -M -r ".name" # <1> <2>
echo "${response}" | jq -M -r ".items.[]" # <3>
echo "${response}" | jq -M -r ".items.[1]" # <4>
----
<1> `-M` disables colored output, `-r` outputs strings without escaped and quotes.
<2> Outputs `John`.
<3> Outputs `Sword` and `Shield` delimited by new line.
<4> Outputs `Shield`.
