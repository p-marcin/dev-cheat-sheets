= Reactive Programming

== Reactive Manifesto

Originally published in *2013*. It is available at https://reactivemanifesto.org[reactivemanifesto.org^]

Reactive Manifesto talks about the system being::
Responsive:::
* The system responds in *a timely manner*.
* Responsiveness is the cornerstone of *usability* and *utility*.
* Responsiveness also means problems may be detected *quickly* and *dealt with effectively*.
* Responsive systems provide *rapid* and *consistent response times*.
* Consistent behavior simplifies *error handling*, builds *end user confidence*, and encourages *further action*.

Resilient:::
* System stays responsive *in the face of failure*.
* Resilience is achieved by *replication*, *containment*, *isolation*, and *delegation*.
* Failures are contained within *each component*.
* Parts of the system *can fail*, without compromising *the system as a whole*.
* Recovery of each component is *delegated to another*.
* *High-availability* is ensured by replication where necessary.

Elastic:::
* The system stays responsive *under varying workload*.
* Reactive Systems can react to changes in the input rate by *increasing* or *decreasing resources* allocated to service inputs.
* Reactive Systems achieve elasticity in a *cost-effective way* on commodity hardware and software platforms.

Message Driven:::
* Reactive Systems rely on *asynchronous message* passing to establish a *boundary between components*.
* This ensures *loose coupling*, *isolation* and *location transparency*.
* Message passing enables *load management*, *elasticity*, and *flow control*.
* Location transparent messaging makes *management of failures possible*.
* Non-blocking communication allows recipients to only *consume resources while active*, leading to *less system overhead*.

== Reactive Programming

*Reactive Programming* is a useful programming paradigm focused on *non-blocking*, *asynchronous execution* - a key characteristic of Reactive Systems.

WARNING: Reactive does *NOT* equal fast! A typical CRUD type application will not see much, if any performance improvement. Reactive can improve computing efficiency, so it is *best used for streaming type applications*.

NOTE: The *immutable nature* of Reactive Applications can help with Application *quality*.

Interactive programs work *at their own pace* and mostly deal with *communication*, while reactive programs only work *in response to external demands* and mostly deal with *accurate interrupt handling*.

Features of Reactive Programming::

Asynchronous:::
* Events are *captured asynchronously*.
* A function is defined to execute *when an event is emitted*.
* Another function is defined *if an error is emitted*.
* Another function is defined *when complete is emitted*.
* This can be a *difficult paradigm* to adjust to when first getting started!

Non-Blocking:::
* In Blocking, the code will *stop and wait* for more data (e.g. reading from disk, network, etc.)
* Non-Blocking will process available data, *ask to be notified* when more is available, then *continue*.

Back Pressure:::
* The ability of the *Subscriber* to *throttle data*.

Failures as Messages:::
* Exceptions are not thrown in *a traditional sense*.
* Would *break* processing of stream.
* Exceptions are processed by *a handler function*.

Data Streams:::
* Reactive Programming focuses on processing streams of data.

== Reactive Streams API

Reactive Streams API is adopted by:

* Akka Streams
* MongoDB
* Ratpack
* Reactive Rabbit
* Project Reactor (Spring 5)
* RxJava
* Slick 3.0
* Vert.x 3.0
* Cassandra
* ElasticSearch
* Kafka
* Play

NOTE: Reactive Streams API is part of the *Java 9*.

Reactive Streams API is a set of *4* Interfaces which define the API:

* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Flow.Publisher.html[`*⚪ Publisher<T>*`^] - a *producer of items* (and related control messages) received by `⚪ Subscriber<T>`.
** Each current `⚪ Subscriber<T>` receives *the same items* (via method `onNext`) in *the same order*, unless drops or errors are encountered.
** If a `⚪ Publisher<T>` encounters *an error* that does not allow items to be issued to a `⚪ Subscriber<T>`, that `⚪ Subscriber<T>` receives `onError`, and then receives *no further messages*.
** Otherwise, when it is known that no further messages will be issued to it, a `⚪ Subscriber<T>` receives `onComplete`.
* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Flow.Subscriber.html[`*⚪ Subscriber<T>*`^] - a *receiver of messages*.
* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Flow.Subscription.html[`*⚪ Subscription*`^] - message control *linking* a `⚪ Publisher<T>` and `⚪ Subscriber<T>`. `⚪ Subscriber<T>` receive items only *when requested*, and *may cancel at any time*.
+
IMPORTANT: The methods in this interface are intended to be invoked only by their `⚪ Subscriber<T>`. Usages in other contexts have undefined effects.
* https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Flow.Processor.html[`*⚪ Processor<T,R>*`^] - a component that *acts as both* a `⚪ Subscriber<T>` and `⚪ Publisher<T>`
