== Segmentation Fault in Debug Mode

Segmentation Fault::
An event resulting in *exit code 139*. It occurs when a process receives a *SIGSEGV* signal, which is generated when the operating system detects that the process is trying to access memory that either does not exist or that it lacks permission to access.

.Start Open Liberty in Debug Mode
[,java]
----
-Dwas.debug.mode=true // <1>
-Dsun.reflect.noInflation=true // <2>
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=7777 // <3>
----
<1> Specific to WebSphere-based servers, including Open Liberty. Enables the internal debugging mode, which modifies how the JVM and Open Liberty handle debugging-related optimizations.
<2> https://publib.boulder.ibm.com/httpserv/cookbook/Java.html#Java-Reflection_Inflation[`sun.reflect.noInflation=true`^]
enables *immediate inflation* on all method invocations. In general, inflated Java bytecode accessors are *faster* than native JNI accessors, at the cost of additional native and Java memory usage.
<3> Enables *Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP)* for remote debugging

Forgetting to set `sun.reflect.noInflation` JVM property in Debug Mode can cause Segmentation Fault, for example, during the invocation of
{hibernate-api-docs}/org/hibernate/Session.html#flush()[`âšª Session#flush()`^] in Hibernate. You might forget to set this JVM property when starting Open Liberty with `ws-server.jar`. However, if you use the
https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/blob/gm-25.0.0.1/dev/com.ibm.ws.kernel.boot.ws-server/publish/bin/server#L1762[`server`^]
script, it is automatically included.

NOTE: The `sun.reflect.noInflation=true` JVM property was added to `server` script as a fix for
https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty/issues/1091[Issue #1091 - Fix for Hot code replace in JAX-RS applications^]
