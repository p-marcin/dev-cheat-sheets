== Overview

Spring Boot DEV Tools are *additional set of tools* that can make the application development experience *a little more pleasant*:

* Application *automatically restart* whenever files on the classpath change (in IntelliJ IDEA you can just `Recompile '.java'` or `Build Project` in `Build` top menu).
* Starts embedded *LiveReload* server that can be used to *trigger a browser refresh* when a resource is changed.
* *Disable caching options* by default, so changes can be seen immediately.
* You can configure *global DEV Tools settings* by adding a file named `.spring-boot-devtools.properties` to your `+${HOME}+` folder. Any properties added to this file will apply to *all* Spring Boot applications on your machine that use DEV Tools.

== IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition

By enabling "Modify Options > On 'Update' Action / On frame deactivation > Update classes and resources" in `Run/Debug Configurations` you can trigger automatic restart of application during these events when using DevTools.
